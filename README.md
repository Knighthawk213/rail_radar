# Rail Radar
**Rail Radar** is a Flutter-based mobile application for **live, pan-India train tracking**, inspired by flight tracking platforms like FlightRadar24 and the Rail Radar feature by Rail Journal.

Instead of searching for trains by number, Rail Radar focuses on **visual, map-based tracking**, allowing users to see trains moving live across India in a more intuitive and interactive way.

---

## Overview

Rail Radar visualizes the **real-time movement of trains on an interactive map**, similar to how flight radar apps work for aviation.

The goal of this project is to build a **scalable, performant foundation** for live railway tracking, with a strong emphasis on:
- clean architecture  
- real-time data handling  
- smooth map-based animations  

The project is currently under **active development**.

## Key Features (WIP)

- Live tracking of running trains across India  
- Interactive map with smooth pan & zoom  
- Real-time location updates using Firebase  
- Train route visualization with polylines  
- Smooth, bidirectional train movement along routes  
- Clean and responsive UI optimized for mobile devices

## What I’m Learning Through This Project

- Handling **real-time data streams** with Firebase  
- Designing **map-based UIs** in Flutter  
- Managing **frequently updating state** efficiently  
- Implementing **smooth movement & interpolation** for live tracking  
- Structuring **scalable Flutter applications** with clean separation of concerns  

---

## Project Status

This project is currently in the **development phase**.

### Planned Next Steps
- Improve realism and smoothness of live movement  
- Optimize map rendering for performance  
- Add clustering for dense train routes  
- Enhance UI/UX for better readability  
- Secure Firestore access for production use
