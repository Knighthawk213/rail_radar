# Rail Radar

*A Flutter-based mobile application for live, pan-India train tracking — inspired by FlightRadar24.*

---

## Overview

**Rail Radar** aims to visualize the **real-time movement of running trains across India** on an interactive map.  
Instead of searching by train numbers, users can **see trains moving live**, making railway tracking more intuitive and visual.

The project is currently under active development and focuses on building a scalable and performant foundation for real-time tracking.

## Key Features (WIP)

- Live tracking of running trains across India  
- Interactive map with smooth pan and zoom  
- Real-time location updates  
- Train route visualization  
- Clean and responsive UI optimized for mobile devices
